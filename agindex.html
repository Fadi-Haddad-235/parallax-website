    <p>
      Artificial intelligence is playing an increasingly important role in 
      Agriculture. Farmers nowadays are facing various kinds of challenges such as 
      climate change in addition to the increase in diseases and pests invations
      which requires innovative solutions. 
      AI algorithms can help farmers make better decisions, 
      increase productivity, and reduce costs through different ways such as
      optimizing crop yields, conserving water and reducing the pesticides usage,
      thereby producing a healthier product with higher quality.

    <h3>Robots in Agriculture</h3>
    <p>
      Agricultural robotics is an emerging field, with developers 
      working to create robots for various applications. 
      These robots are being designed to perform various tasks such 
      as picking ripened fruits, weeding, and planting which are 
      some of the biggest challenges in agriculture especially during harvest 
      seasons. To illustrate better, robots can perform these tasks with better efficiency 
      and consistency compared to humans, which reduces labor costs and 
      increases productivity. Additionally, robots can help 
      reduce the amount of pesticide use by selectively targeting 
      weeds and pests.

      Drones in Agriculture
    </h3>
    <p>
      Drones are becoming widely used in agriculture nowadays, 
      as they provide a cost-effective and efficient way to survey 
      fields and collect information. These Drones are equipped with high-resolution 
      cameras and other sensors which can provide valuable data on crop health, water usage, and soil 
      quality. Farmers can use this data to take informed decisions 
      about when to plant, water, spray, and harvest their crops. Moreover, drones can be used to monitor crops for 
      pests and diseases, allowing farmers to take preventative measures before any significant damage occurs.
