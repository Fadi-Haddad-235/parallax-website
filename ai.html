            <h2>Intelligent Driving Revolution</h2><br>
            <p class="paragraph1">
                Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the automotive industry, enabling cars to become
                 <br>more efficient,safer, and more intelligent. AI is being used in a range of applications,<br>
                  from advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to fully autonomous vehicles. <br><br>
                  AI algorithms can help cars to perceive their environment,
                 make decisions,<br> and take actions in real-time, all without human intervention.The ability
                  of AI to analyze <br>vast amounts of data and make complex decisions quickly and accurately is 
                  particularly<br> useful in the automotive industry. AI algorithms can help cars to detect and 
                  respond to a wide range of situations, including obstacles on the road, changing traffic conditions,
                   and potential collisions with other vehicles or pedestrians.

        <h2>AI in automated cars</h2>
        <p class="paragraph2">
            AI plays a critical role in automated cars, which are also known as autonomous or self-driving cars. 
            Here are some of <br>the ways that AI is used in automated cars:<br><br>
        </p>
     <ol>
        <li>Perception: Automated cars are equipped with a range of sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, 
            which collect data about the car's environment. AI algorithms then analyze this data to identify objects,
            such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles, and determine their distance and movement.</li><br>
            <li>Navigation: Automated cars use GPS and mapping data to determine their location and plan a route
                 to their destination. AI algorithms can analyze this data to optimize the car's route, 
                taking into account factors such as traffic congestion, road conditions, and weather.</li><br>
                <li>Learning: AI algorithms can learn from a car's experiences on the road, improving the car's performance over time.
                     For example, if an automated car encounters a new situation that it hasn't encountered before,
                     the car's AI system can learn from this experience and adjust its behavior accordingly.</li><br>
                     <li>Decision-making: Once an automated car's sensors have detected its surroundings, AI algorithms can use this information
                         to make decisions about how the car should behave. For example, if a car's sensors detect a pedestrian crossing the road,
                         the car's AI system can decide to slow down or stop to avoid a collision.</li>
